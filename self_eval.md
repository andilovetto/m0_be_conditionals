# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? if you need to compare the values of two different variables
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? Step away from the assignment and take a breather, after I did that it was much more clear how I should complete it. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? I love understanding more about Ruby. This exercise gave me practice in areas I very much so appreciated. I loved getting to work more with the conditionals and if/elsif statements. I enjoyed the coding challenge as well, I looked up the odd boolean method from Ruby-doc and employed that method in my code.
